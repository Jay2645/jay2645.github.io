Hello! This is Jay Stevens' homepage!

You can view my [game design](/games/) work, my [level design](/levels/) work, various [3D models](/models/) I've made, as well as my [resume](/resume).

Right now I'm looking for a job in the game design, level design, or game scripting/programming fields. I'm currently based in the Southern California area (Orange County), but can relocate. [View my contact info here!](/about)
