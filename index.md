Hello! My name is Jay Stevens! I love designing game systems and watching my designs come to life.

I'm a college student looking for a job in the game design, level design, or game scripting/programming fields.

![Picture of me](/assets/images/bio-photo-small.png){: .align-left} I'm currently based in the Southern California area (Orange County), but can relocate. You can [view my resume here](/resume), or just [view my contact info](/about).

I also have some software development experience outside of game development, which you can see on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Jay2645). Examples are my [websocket-based Pokemon battle bot](https://github.com/Jay2645/Geniusect-2.0) and [some work I did on the Home Assistant home automation platform](https://github.com/Jay2645/home-assistant/tree/add-todoist). I've also created [a text adventure engine in C#](https://github.com/Jay2645/text-adventure), although I haven't maintained it in a while.

# About Me

I've been a lifelong gamer who's dreamed of working in the game development field since I was 12 years old. As a kid, I was obsessed with *Halo*, and the first custom maps I ever made were for *Halo: Custom Edition*, the PC version of *Halo 1*.

My favorite languages to work in are Python, C++, and C# (in that order, roughly). I also have some experience with both Java and JavaScript, although I don't use them as heavily as I do the other 3. Additionally, I'm comfortable working in Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk 3DS Max. I'm currently living in Santa Ana, CA, in an apartment with my girlfriend and our cat, Moo (yes, like a cow).

As far as games are concerned, my favorite games to play are real-time strategy games, mostly Paradox Interactive titles like *Europa Universalis 4*, *Hearts of Iron 4*, and *Stellaris*. I'm also a big fan of *Overwatch*, *Star Citizen*, and *Hearthstone*, as well as some titles on the Nintendo Switch like *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* and *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*.

When it comes to making games, I have a tendency to gravitate towards shooters and platforming games. I really enjoy designing game systems -- things like interactions between different NPC "factions," procedural level generation, player ability/skill systems, etc.
