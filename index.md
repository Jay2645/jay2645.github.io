Hello! This is Jay Stevens' homepage!

You can view my [game design](/games/) work, my [level design](/levels/) work, various [3D models](/models/) I've made, as well as my [resume](/resume).

I also have some non-game-related experience, which you can see on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Jay2645). Examples are my [websocket-based Pokemon battle bot](https://github.com/Jay2645/Geniusect-2.0) and [some work I did on the Home Assistant home automation platform](https://github.com/Jay2645/home-assistant/tree/add-todoist). I've also created [a text adventure engine in C#](https://github.com/Jay2645/text-adventure), although I haven't maintained it in a while.

My favorite languages to work in are Python, C++, and C# (in that order, roughly). I also have some experience with both Java and JavaScript, although I don't use them as heavily as I do the other 3.

Right now I'm looking for a job in the game design, level design, or game scripting/programming fields. I'm currently based in the Southern California area (Orange County), but can relocate. [View my contact info here!](/about)
