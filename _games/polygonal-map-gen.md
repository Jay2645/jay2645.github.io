# [Polygonal Map Generator](https://github.com/Jay2645/Unreal-Polygonal-Map-Gen)

A map generator that uses a delaunay triangulation to generate islands, built in C++ for Unreal Engine 4.

This is a port of [the JavaScript code](https://github.com/amitp/mapgen2) of [Red Blob Games' *Polygonal Map Generation for Games*](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/). I worked alone on the port.

This port is written in C++ and designed to work in Unreal Engine 4 using the Unreal Engine 4 "Plugin" system. This port works fully with games written in C++ as well as games that use Unreal Engine 4's "Blueprint" visual scripting language.
