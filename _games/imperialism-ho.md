An exploration/management game set in the jungle, circa 1927. You run a shipping company in a British outpost, and you take supplies downriver to sell to the local natives/explorers/etc. There are random events in the jungle that may or may not affect your trip -- elephants might spawn in one area, which probably won't affect you (unless you want to kill them for the ivory), or you might have to deal with a lion stalking you and trying to attack.

Once you get the goods you're trying to deliver to the natives (or whoever you're dealing with), you barter with them to get some different goods (ivory, gems, archaeological artifacts, etc.) that you can then go sell to the British liaison. This will give you cash that you can use to buy more goods you can sell (as you're done bartering, the people you're dealing with will give you a list of what they need and the price they'd be willing to pay for it), upgrade the ship you're using to navigate the river, etc.

Keep your eyes peeled, as you might discover a lost temple filled to the brim with treasures -- or you might discover a rival trying to get to the treasures before you!

Imperialism, Ho! is still a work in progress. The above gallery features older screenshots from the game's prototype phase; the final version will use a simplified "low-poly" artstyle and will feature procedurally-generated jungles. The dungeon-crawling aspect has a prototype of its own; see [Traps and Treasure](/games/traps-and-treasure). The game's [Map Generation](https://github.com/Jay2645/Unreal-Polygonal-Map-Gen) and [Dungeon Generation](https://github.com/Jay2645/DungeonMaker) are both open-source.
