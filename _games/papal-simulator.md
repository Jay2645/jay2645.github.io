Papal Simulator began being worked on around the time the *Surgeon Simulator* hit the mainstream, before a bunch of other "simulators" hit the market. Pope Francis had just become the new Pope and was all over the news, which was all I needed for one simple idea: "What about a game where you could *be* the Pope?"

Unfortunately, that was all the game I came up with. I wound up getting it to work on mobile, but there wasn't much in the way of game -- it was just "scroll across the screen and wear funny hats."

The "final" interpretation of the game was a *WarioWare*-esque mishmash of vaguely Pope-related ideas: You woke up every morning and got the latest news about what was going on in the world. You could pray to God for some advice, you could react to any news publicly, you could write a letter to a foreign head of state, you could go visit another country (and drive the Popemobile), and... that was about it. Doing different things made different numbers go up and down, but it was hard to find a satisfying way of doing things without offending the world's entire Catholic population.

In the end, as cool of an idea as it was, it's probably best that it stays an idea.
