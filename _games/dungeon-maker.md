# Dungeon Generator

A system for generating Zelda-like dungeons in UE4, using generative grammars.

This code was inspired from the articles ["Adventures in Level Design: Generating Missions and
Spaces for Action Adventure Games"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5716/8efaa56e7ee7742444a56c683e77738146cb.pdf) (PDF) and ["The Zelda Dungeon Generator: Adopting Generative Grammars to Create Levels for Action-Adventure Games
"](http://www.beckylavender.co.uk/uploads/1/5/1/4/15147006/zelda-dissertation.pdf) (PDF, main website is [here](http://www.beckylavender.co.uk/the-zelda-dungeon-generator.html)).

The grammar state machine is based on [the state machine created in one of Epic Games' live training sessions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr9ybCCPw9Y)
