Shoot for the Moon began life as [an entry for Ludum Dare 40, "The more you have, the worse it is."](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/knockback)  I'm proud that I placed fairly high in the "fun" category (164th out of 2886).

{% include gallery caption="Pictures of the prototype." %}

After the jam, work continued on the game, with a departure from the stock Unreal Engine models and a more solid codebase. Online play is supported, as well as local co-op. My ultimate goal is a PC and Nintendo Switch release.

I created the Space Station and character models shown above. I also did all game design, level design, and code.
