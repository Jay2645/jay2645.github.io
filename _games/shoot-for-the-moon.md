Shoot for the Moon began life as [an entry for Ludum Dare 40, "The more you have, the worse it is."](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/knockback) 

My entry had to be cut short due to a family emergency midway through the jam, but I'm still proud that I placed fairly high in the "fun" category (164th out of 2886).

{% include gallery caption="Pictures of the prototype." %}

After the jam, work continued on the game, with a departure from the stock Unreal Engine models and a more solid codebase. Online play is supported, as well as local co-op. My ultimate goal is a PC and Nintendo Switch release.
