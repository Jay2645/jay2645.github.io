*Schemepunk* was the first game I ever worked on by myself, created in the Unity Engine. The game itself was nothing to look at -- I was just learning how to code at the time, so the project was far too ambitious for my skillset back then. However, I made a bunch of models for the game that I'm still really proud of, some of which are showcased here.
