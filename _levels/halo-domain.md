After multiple failed attempts at finishing maps for *Halo: Custom Edition* (see [my unfinished Star Wars mod](/models/star-wars)), I finally set my mind out to finish a Halo map. I was 15 years old at the time I was making this map.

Halo, of course, came out in the early 2000s, and its iteration tools weren't the best. Every map had to be completely sealed without any overlapping edges or "holes," and the only supported version of 3DS Max was 3DS Max 8. Once a map was imported, it took all night to run the lighting calculations in order to even have anything on the map become visible.

Because of this, rapid iteration was a *pain,* but I was dedicated to finally putting out a map of my own. I was still fairly new to creating my own maps, so I decided to use *Halo 2*'s map "Turf" as inspiration. I didn't have any way of importing the raw models, so instead I used a stopwatch and trial and error to determine how big the map should be, what the gaps between jumps were, etc.

I didn't want it to be a "true" recreation -- I modified the level layout a bit to solve some of the issues with the original map, and I set the theme to match concept art for the (then unreleased) *Halo 3: ODST*.

I'm proud of this map; of all my *Halo 1* maps, it's the one that got the most traction and the best reviews, scoring a 9.1/10. There's a couple videos of it on YouTube, to show off the gameplay (disclaimer: This isn't my video, just one I found playing on the map).
