After multiple failed attempts at finishing maps for *Halo: Custom Edition* (see [my unfinished Star Wars mod](/models/star-wars)), I finally set my mind out to finish a Halo map.

I was 14 years old at the time, and I was still fairly new to creating my own maps, so I decided to use *Halo 2*'s map "Turf" as inspiration. I didn't have any way of importing the raw models, so instead I used a stopwatch and trial and error to determine how big the map should be, what the gaps between jumps were, etc.

{% include gallery caption="Screenshots of the map." %}

I didn't want it to be a "true" recreation -- I modified the level layout a bit to solve some of the issues with the original map, and I set the theme to match concept art for the (then unreleased) *Halo 3: ODST*.

I'm proud of this map; it got a lot of traction and good reviews, scoring a 9.1/10. There's a couple videos of it on YouTube, to show off the gameplay (disclaimer: This isn't my video, just one I found):
