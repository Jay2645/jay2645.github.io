{% include gallery caption="The first *Team Fortress 2* map I ever made, Dockyard." %}

Dockyard was a "payload" map, which involved one team trying to push a cart carrying a bomb into the other team's base. One interesting mechanic in the level was the use of trains running back and forth, which would kill players on contact.

There was one point where the bomb would be able to stop on the train tracks -- when the train hit the bomb, the bomb would explode and the game would be considered a tie. Players didn't like that during playtests, so it was changed first to having the defenders win before finally the bomb would naturally slide off the train tracks when left idle, and would refuse to move forward if there was a chance that it would be hit by a train. I was disappointed that the feature didn't make it in, but ultimately it just wasn't popular during playtesting.
