Nippon was my entry for a "Build Around the Track" *Team Fortress 2* contest, where participants were given a pre-made Payload track layout and were asked to build a level using that track.

Japan didn't have much representation in *Team Fortress 2*, so I decided to create a map based in Japan. I'm really pleased with how it turned out; it's probably my favorite *Team Fortress* map that I've ever made.
