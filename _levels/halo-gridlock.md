After the success of my previous map, ["Domain"](/levels/halo-domain), I was inspired to make a "sequel." This was my first time designing a map without using an already-made map as a reference.

{% include gallery caption="Gridlock pictures." %}

As with Domain, Gridlock was inspired by *Halo 3: ODST*, and some sections were directly taken from ODST concept art:

![Gridlock ODST concept]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/level-halo-gridlock-5-concept.jpg)
{: .full}

![Gridlock render 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/level-halo-gridlock-5.jpg)
{: .full}

![Gridlock render 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/level-halo-gridlock-5a.jpg)
{: .full}

![Gridlock render 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/level-halo-gridlock-5b.jpg)
{: .full}

Gridlock's development was... troubled, to say the least. The first iteration of the map was somewhat rushed, and I wasn't happy with the results. I wound up deciding to completely remodel the map from scratch, making it much "cleaner" and less rushed this time. However, life got in the way, and I was never able to properly finish Gridlock or give it an actual release.

Even so, somehow the map's files are still out on the internet somewhere. When using Google to try and pull up old renders of the map for my portfolio, I came across some people playing the first version of the map.

As a disclaimer, this is not my video, just one I found:
