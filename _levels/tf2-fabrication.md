Fabrication was my first "Control Point" map, where players would try to capture all 5 control points -- 2 owned by the RED team, 2 owned by the BLU team, and 1 that started neutral.

Because I was still fairly new to making maps with Team Fortress 2, Fabrication was a very "vanilla" map. I wanted to make a map that had a lot of verticality to it, and ultimately it was a fun map that a lot of players enjoyed.
