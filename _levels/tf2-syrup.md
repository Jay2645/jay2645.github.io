Syrup was a "King of the Hill" map made for *Team Fortress 2*, with a restriction that it had to be made in 72 hours. It was set in a Syrup mill, with the name being a pun on the prefix associated with Team Fortress 2 "King of the Hill" maps: KOTH_Syrup.

This was the last map I would make in *Team Fortress* before moving on to creating games of my own, but I still had a ton of fun making this and playtesting it despite the tight time constraint.
