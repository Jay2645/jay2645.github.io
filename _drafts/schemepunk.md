Schemepunk was the first-ever game I tried to make. I taught myself C# to make it (I had previously taken a single Java class in college).

See also [the models page](/models/schemepunk) for a collection of models I included within the game.

The gameplay involved 2 modes:

* A top-down real-time strategy mode, where you commanded units in a "classical" RTS manner

* A first-person shooter mode, where you "possessed" a unit and took control of it. For example, you could fly a plane attacking an airship, or you could become the captain of an airship and walk around on deck, giving orders to your crew (a couple years later, the game *Guns of Icarus Online* would do exactly that).

I had vast ambitions and little experience, which was ultimately the death of this project. It's still a neat idea, but *Guns of Icarus Online* has filled part of the niche I wanted to fill, and ultimately I moved on to other projects.
